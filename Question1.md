1. (5 points) Based on the chart above, analyze the problem from the perspective of a
software developer, choosing technology to meet user needs that increase or decrease
over time while saving construction costs to build, operating and maintain systems for
businesses. Give at least 3 reasons for your choice:


1. Analysis for Technology Choice:
Reasons for Technology Choice:

Scalability: Given the varying shopping demand throughout the year, especially during events like Black Friday, the chosen technology should allow for easy scalability. Cloud-based solutions, such as Microsoft Azure or AWS, provide the flexibility to scale resources up or down based on demand. This ensures that the system can handle increased traffic during peak periods without incurring high construction costs.

Cost-Efficiency: Cloud services follow a pay-as-you-go model, allowing businesses to optimize costs. During periods of low demand, resources can be scaled down, reducing operational costs. This cost-efficiency is particularly advantageous for a retail company with fluctuating demand throughout the year.

Rapid Development and Deployment: To save construction costs and speed up development, technologies that facilitate rapid development and deployment should be chosen. Modern frameworks like ASP.NET Core for backend development, combined with frontend frameworks like React or Angular, enable faster development cycles and quicker time-to-market.
